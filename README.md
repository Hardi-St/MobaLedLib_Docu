# MobaLedLib
Arduino library for controlling LEDs and other components on a model railway.

The use of RGB LEDs offers fascinating possibilities for lighting a model railway:
- Infinite number of lighting effects - Brightness and color of each LED can be
  set individually and dynamically
- Easiest cabling - The objects (houses, traffic lights, ...) are simply plugged
  into a multiple socket
- Extremely affordable - 100 LEDs for the price of three "normal" lights
- Up to 256 RGB LEDs (768 channels) can be controlled by an Arduino
- Controlling other components is just as easy
  - Sound modules
  - Servo and stepper motors
  - Power devices
- Additional module to read 80 and more switches with 10 signal wires
- Stand-alone operation or networked with other components possible

The lighting and some additional functions are controlled via the WS2812 / WS2811 chips.
For this, only a single signal is required which is forwarded from one chip to the next.
This makes the wiring extremely easy.

A lot of examples show the usage of the library. They could be use as startup for own programs.


This library is described in detail here:

Several videos which demonstrate the library are available in the following pages in the forum.
