The content of the ZIP file has to be extracted to 
   %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries\MobaLedLib\

Attention: The directory structure must be retained:
+---MobaLedLib
    \---examples
    +---extras
    \---src

The “-master” in the directory name must be deleted!
“MobaLedLib-master” => “MobaLedLib”

After copying the files
  %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries\MobaLedLib\extras\Prog_Generator_MobaLedLib.xlsm
is started.


Attention: The path has to be adapted if an other SketchBook path is used in the Arduino IDE
